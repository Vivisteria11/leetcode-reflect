### Problem: 11. Container With Most Water

🏷 Topic: Container With Most Water (LeetCode #11)

🤖 GPT Feedback:
Here's my feedback on your solution:

Feedback:
Your solution is correct. It successfully finds the maximum area of water that can be trapped in a container given the positions of the left and right bars.

Efficiency: The time complexity of your solution is O(n), where n is the number of bars. This is because you are iterating through the bars once. The space complexity is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input and is a constant.

Improvements:
1. Your solution is already efficient and has a good time complexity. It's rare to have solutions that are already optimal in terms of efficiency.
2. However, you could improve the readability of your code by adding comments to explain what your code is doing. This can make it easier for others (and yourself) to understand your code in the future.

💻 Your Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int left = 0, right = height.size() - 1;
        int maxArea = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            // Calculate the current area
            int width = right - left;
            int currentArea = min(height[left], height[right]) * width;

            // Update the maximum area
            maxArea = max(maxArea, currentArea);

            // Move the pointer of the smaller height to potentially find a better answer
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }

        return maxArea;
    }
};
```

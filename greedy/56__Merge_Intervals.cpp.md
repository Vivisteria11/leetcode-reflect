### Problem: 56. Merge Intervals

🏷 Topic: greedy

🤖 LLM Feedback:
Congratulations on solving the "Merge Intervals" problem! Here's a detailed review of your code:

**Correctness:**

Your code seems to be correct. It sorts the intervals based on their start time and then iterates through the sorted intervals. For each interval, it checks if the result vector is empty or if the end time of the last interval in the result is less than the start time of the current interval. If either condition is true, it adds the current interval to the result. Otherwise, it merges the current interval with the last interval in the result by updating the end time of the last interval.

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of your code is O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals. This is because you are sorting the intervals using the `sort` function, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). The subsequent iteration through the sorted intervals has a time complexity of O(n), but this is dominated by the sorting time complexity. Therefore, the overall time complexity is still O(n log n).

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of your code is O(n), where n is the number of intervals. This is because you are storing the result intervals in a vector.

**Suggestions to Improve:**

1. Consistent Naming Conventions: Your code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable names. It's better to stick to a consistent naming convention throughout the code. For example, you can use underscore notation for variable names and camelCase for function names.
2. Comments: While your code is generally easy to understand, it could benefit from additional comments to explain the purpose of the code and any complex logic. For example, you could add a comment to explain why you are sorting the intervals based on their start time.
3. Redundant Variable: In the `for` loop, you don't need to check if `result.empty()` explicitly. You can simply use `if (result.back()[1] < interval[0])` to check the condition.
4. Coding Style: Your code formatting is good, but some lines are quite long. Consider breaking them up into shorter lines for better readability.
5. Error Handling: Your code assumes that the input intervals are valid and will never contain overlapping intervals. It would be better to add error handling to handle such scenarios.

Here's an updated version of your code with some of these suggestions implemented:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;

        // Sort the intervals based on their start time
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[0] < b[0];
        });

        for (auto& interval : intervals) {
            if (result.empty() || result.back()[1] < interval[0]) {
                result.push_back(interval);
            } else {
                result.back()[1] = max(result.back()[1], interval[1]);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

Overall, your code is correct and well-structured. With a few minor tweaks, it can become even more readable and maintainable.

💻 Your Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {

        vector<vector<int>> result;

        sort(intervals.begin(),intervals.end());

        for(auto& interval:intervals)
        {
            
              
              if(result.empty() || result.back()[1] < interval[0]){
                result.push_back(interval);
              }
              else{
                result.back()[1] = max(result.back()[1],interval[1]);
              }
        
        }


        return result;
    }
};
```
